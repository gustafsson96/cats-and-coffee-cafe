# Cats and Coffee Café

**Link to live website: [Cats and Coffee Café](https://gustafsson96.github.io/cats-and-coffee-cafe/)**

Cats and Coffee Café is the ultimate hybrid of a café and a cat rescue organization, located in Stockholm, Sweden. The website is targeted towards people who like cats, both those looking for a unique and fun café experience and those looking to adopt a rescue cat. This website contains the most important information for a potential visitor/cat adopter: address and opening hours, contact information, images of the cats, an adoption form, and text content guiding the user depending on their purpose of visiting the site (such as encouragement to fill out adoption form or where contact information can be found).

### Lighthouse report

The screenshot above shows the results from my first lighthouse report. I decided I wanted to see if I could improve the accessibility score and therefore added aria-label attributes to the social media links (as suggested in the lighhouse report). This resulted in an accessibility score of 100 after running a second lighthouse report, results below:

### Bugs

#### Solved Bugs

+ Problem: After I first deployed my project, none of the image files in my HTML code would load on the page.
