# Cats and Coffee Café

Cats and Coffee Café is a fictional café located in Stockholm, Sweden. The website is mainly targeted towards people with an interest for cats who want a fun and unique experience, but also towards those looking to adopt a cat. This website contains the most important information for a potential visitor/adopter: address and opening hours, an "About Us" section, a gallery with images of the cats, and adoption form, and contact information including links to social media.
