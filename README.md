# Cats and Coffee Café

Cats and Coffee Café is a fictional café located in Stockholm, Sweden. The website is mainly targeted towards people with an interest for cats who want a fun and unique experience, but also towards those looking to adopt a cat. This website contains the most important information for a potential visitor/adopter: address and opening hours, an "About Us" section, a gallery with images of the cats, and adoption form, and contact information including links to social media.

The screenshot above shows the results from my first lighthouse report. I decided I wanted to see if I could improve the accessibility score and therefore added aria-label attributes to the social media links (as suggested in the lighhouse report). This resulted in an accessibility score of 100 after running a second lighthouse report, results below:
